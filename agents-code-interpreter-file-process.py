"""
DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to use agent operations with the code interpreter tool to 
    analyze excel and csv files

USAGE:
    python agents-code-interpreter.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    1) PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your
       Azure AI Foundry project.
    2) MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The deployment name of the AI model, as found under the "Name" column in 
       the "Models + endpoints" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.
